# Tickets

There is no code in this repo – only [issues](https://github.com/codeforberlin/tickets/issues) (hence the name 'tickets'). Here, we want to collect tasks and new projects that can be done for or within the Code for Berlin / open data / civic tech community.

## Why?

This repo should help us in the process of on-boarding new OK lab members. After our monthly 'open lab' meetings, we often have a bunch of people who want to join. But they often ask questions such as "Where do you need help? What can I do?". And in the past, we didn't had good answers. With the issues, they should have a starting point.
